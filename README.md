# ISLE Blazegraph

## Part of the ISLE Islandora 7.x Docker Images
An alternative graph database server to ISLE Fedora's default [Resource Index](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA38/Resource+Index) module configuration usage of [Mulgara](http://www.mulgara.org/download.html), "_a RDF database written entirely in Java._"

Blazegraph is a ultra high-performance triplestore and graph database which can performantly support higher levels of triples than Mulgara.

    * Tomcat 8.5.x

Contains and Includes:
* [Blazegraph](https://www.blazegraph.com/) 2.1.5 an ultra high-performance graph database / server
